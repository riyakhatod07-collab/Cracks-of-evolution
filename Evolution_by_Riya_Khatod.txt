Evolution
by Riya Khatod

I lived in an ocean, blue all I peek in,
Comfort but disgrace, peace all I seek in,
Turns for rat race, unknown I went sneakin’,
Eureka fades, darkness shades as I peeped in.

I was told to bye my ocean, to grow on sand,
As I glared, greenery shared, people call me land.
I fumed up, tried to breathe and God gifted me a gland.
Went to the blues and green at a time, but it didn’t work planned.

I decided to end the ocean, who offered a holy crate,
Said, “Box up your feelings, as land doesn’t share fate.”
I lost my limbs as I crawled deadly to destiny’s gate.
There were many resembles already, maybe I was late.

Soon I was thrown to a hopeless ground,
Surrounded by monsters and creatures who kicked me for a pound.
I hid, resisted, and all evils were knocked out by sound.
And so I was gifted with wings I found.

I roared in skies with my elegant flies.
I landed on flowers to stand straight and open my eyes.
‘Man’, as I was called now, led the world without ties.
This is what ‘Evolution’, as the new science implies.
